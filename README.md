# CantoMap, the Cantonese MapTask corpus
The Cantonese MapTask corpus is a collection of recordings of the MapTask task in contemporary Hong Kong Cantonese.

The corpus contains the following:
- Recordings of the sessions of the MapTask are in the folder "ConversationData". Each sub-folder contains audio files and corresponding ELAN files that contain the transcription of the audio in Chinese characters (both non-segmented and manually segmented) and jyutping romanization.
- Recordings of the reading task where participants read words aloud from a list are in the folder "ReadingData".
- The maps used for the task are in the folder "Maps".

In total, the corpus offers 12 hours and 48 minutes of recordings.
